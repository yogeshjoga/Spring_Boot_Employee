Given four files `EmployeeController.java`, `EmployeeRepository.java`, `EmployeeService.java` and  `Employee.java`.
The `EmployeeService` class has a variable named `employeeList`, which is a HashMap that holds `Integer`s as keys and `Employee` objects as values. Initially, it contains data of **6** employees.

### Completion Instructions

- `Employee.java`: `Employee` class should contain the following attributes.

    |  Attribute   |  Type  |
    | :----------: | :----: |
    |  employeeId  |  int   |
    | employeeName | String |
    |    email     | String |
    |  department  | String |

- `EmployeeRepository.java`: Create an `interface` containing required methods.
- `EmployeeService.java`: Update the service class with logic for managing employee data.
- `EmployeeController.java`: Create the controller class to handle HTTP requests.
